# Product Direction

This document describes Burrete's product intent. It is not a release checklist,
marketing page, or complete feature specification. Keep it aligned with
`README.md`, the active desktop app, the Quick Look extension, the source-built
iPhone app, and the agent/plugin surface.

## Current Product

Burrete is a molecular file workspace with four connected surfaces:

- Finder Quick Look previews for molecular files.
- A compact macOS desktop workspace for opening, comparing, editing, and
  triaging molecular/project files.
- A source-built iPhone preview app that reuses the preview runtime for mobile
  document handoff.
- Agent/plugin tooling for typed observe/action workflows, reports, and bounded
  molecular workspace automation.

The product is a local molecular workspace for inspection, workflow handoff,
and a curated set of reproducible native compute operations. It is not a cloud
ELN, collaborative notebook, arbitrary script environment, or unrestricted
molecular-modeling suite.

## Native Compute Layer Status

The Apple Silicon Compute Layer is under active implementation. The first
desktop source workflow now runs from immutable Grid scope through a pinned
RDKit worker, checked CPU/Metal Tanimoto neighbor construction, deterministic
Butina, immutable artifacts, and typed Grid results. Real Metal command-buffer
dispatch exists, and the current v20 development package compiles, bundles,
hash-verifies, installs, launches, and dispatches its precompiled runtime on an
Apple M2 Pro. Production distribution remains gated on external Developer ID/
hardened-runtime signing, notarization, and final UI-triggered acceptance
evidence.

| Workflow family | Product status |
| --- | --- |
| Similarity and clustering | `Cluster selected`/`Cluster filtered`/`Cluster all` is wired end to end with active cancellation at durable stage boundaries; deterministic v20 tests cover a 100k exact query and 100k CSR construction without a dense matrix, priority-queue Butina, dense fill, exact cutoff boundaries, and rejection before fill under memory pressure |
| Similarity search and diverse selection | `Find similar` reuses a verified cluster EnginePack for exact CPU/Metal top-50 ranking and Grid writeback; immutable diverse export includes structures, table, and provenance |
| Conformer generation | Native Grid selection runs RDKit parameter extraction, adaptive `N x K` Metal DG/ETK/stereo execution, CPU reference validation, durable EnginePack/ResultPack publication, typed Grid writeback, and path-based Mol* ensemble opening; a 32-case all-variant packaged-RDKit/real-Metal corpus passes, while external coordinate-distribution and production-package gates remain |
| MMFF94/MMFF94s optimization | Seven-term CPU/Metal evaluation, BMFX RDKit parameter ABI, fused Metal BFGS/L-BFGS selection, selectable conformer ranking, standalone input-coordinate `Optimize geometry`, and Grid/XYZ provenance are implemented; the 24-case pinned RDKit corpus passes on Apple M2 Pro |
| Alignment, RMSD, shape/electrostatic scoring | Grid `Align & compare` performs bounded Metal Horn alignment, deterministic V2000/V3000 element/bond-graph remapping, CPU parity validation, typed Grid score writeback, aligned annotated SDF/Mol* ensemble opening, and electrostatic scoring from a complete common semiempirical charge run when available; the pinned upstream CHEESE transform/charge fixture and reordered Grid-to-Metal smoke pass |
| Semiempirical energies and charges | Native Grid evaluation covers RM1, AM1, PM3, PM6, PM6_D, PM6_D3H4, PM6_SP, and AM1* with method-specific domains, SCF/DIIS/adaptive damping, full PM6 d orbitals, D3/H4/HH corrections, energies, charges, and CPU/Metal checks; broad external corpus and production-package gates remain |

Production compute is native Metal plus native CPU/reference chemistry. Python
and MLX are permitted only in development as pinned reference oracles and are
not ordinary application dependencies.

The concrete Grid flows, input/action matrix, and reusable execution contract
are documented in [Native Compute User Stories](gpu-compute-user-stories.md).

## Primary Users

Burrete is for people who inspect molecular and adjacent computational chemistry
files as part of technical work:

- computational chemists
- structural biologists
- cheminformaticians
- molecular modeling practitioners
- researchers and engineers reviewing generated structure/workflow artifacts

They often enter through Finder, a project folder, a generated workflow output,
or an agent session. They need fast visual feedback, predictable file handling,
and a way to recover when renderer or Quick Look infrastructure needs attention.

## Core Jobs

- Preview a molecular file from Finder without opening a heavyweight tool.
- Open multiple structures or related files in a desktop workspace and compare
  them without losing renderer state.
- Switch between Mol*, RDKit grids, text/spectrum fallbacks, and external
  `xyzrender` when the file or workflow requires it.
- Inspect SDF/SMILES/CSV/TSV collections with search, sorting, filtering,
  selection, append/merge, export, and Ketcher handoff.
- Sketch or edit small molecules in Ketcher and send them to preview or
  collection workflows.
- Review focused workflow artifacts such as docking/pose surfaces and FEP
  network GraphML previews.
- Diagnose and repair local preview infrastructure: Quick Look reset, cache
  cleanup, logs, diagnostics, update checks, and install health.
- Use typed agent workflows where screenshots are not enough: open, observe,
  act, render bounded panels, and validate molecular artifacts.
- Run curated similarity, conformer, optimization, alignment, and energy
  workflows from Grid or the 3D inspector once each workflow reaches its
  packaged-app completion gate.
- Build and use the iPhone app from source for mobile file handoff and
  inspection.

## Product Principles

- **Molecule first.** The structure, collection, trajectory, spectrum, or
  workflow artifact is the visual center. Shell UI exists to support inspection.
- **Native enough to trust.** Burrete should feel like a serious macOS utility:
  predictable menus, keyboard access, stable window behavior, familiar controls,
  and clear recovery actions.
- **Surface truth matters.** Finder Quick Look, desktop app, browser-dev,
  tokenized browser preview, iPhone app, and agent sessions are separate
  runtimes. Product claims must say which surface is supported.
- **File workflows beat dashboards.** Burrete is organized around files,
  project folders, tabs, previews, and handoff, not hero metrics or abstract
  workspace cards.
- **Local first.** The app should work from local files and local tools. External
  integrations such as `xyzrender`, VESTA, chemistry editors, and agent tooling
  remain optional and explicit.
- **Maintenance is product UX.** Quick Look registration, renderer discovery,
  logs, cache reset, and install checks are first-class because broken local
  preview infrastructure is a common user problem.

## Non-Goals

- Replace full molecular modeling environments.
- Provide macromolecule editing inside Ketcher.
- Hide local tool requirements behind silent cloud execution.
- Turn the desktop shell into a marketing-style dashboard.
- Treat the source-built iPhone app as part of the Homebrew macOS release.
- Let agent screenshots replace typed observe/action state or validation output.

## Voice

Burrete should sound practical, direct, and precise. User-facing copy should say
what the app can do, what surface it applies to, and what the user can do next.
Avoid aspirational claims that are not backed by README, docs, tests, or the
current runtime.
